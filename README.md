## Theme Notes

This theme supports video. You can also use a scraped image in conjunction with the video. If you scrape both, when a game is selected, it will show the screenshot for a couple of seconds before fading and playing the video.

Game screenshots are not included within the theme. You can scrape your own - you should use game boxart/screenshots and/or videos.
